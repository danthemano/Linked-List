# Linked-List
A function that takes as input the head of a linked list and a target value.
The function then iterates through the linked list and deletes every duplicate node with the target value and appends the node with the target value as the last element of the list.
If the element is not in the list, the function creates a node with the target value and appends it to the end of the list.
